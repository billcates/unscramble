Task 0 -It is a constant and it will always a constant amount of time.O(1)
Task 1 -texts perfoms n times and calls perform n times therefore O(n)
Task 2 -iterate n time and check for the condition therefore O(n)
Task 3 -iterates n time (i.e )O(n) and uses a sorted function which takes O(n logn).
        For Big O complexity, all we care about is the dominant term. n log(n) dominates n
        therefore the time complexity is O(n log n)
Task 4 - In line 27.It find the texters by using a list comprehension which when
          when implemented normally takes a loop inside a loop and its time
          complexity is O(n^2)(i.e )quadratic and call_receivers takes O(n)
          and marketers also takes O(n).therefore the time complexity is
          quadratic O(n^2)
